# From First Principles

This repository is a collection of real products examined through the lens of
engineering.

Each entry will start with a brief description of the product and
their fundamental equations, then work toward the final product design.

This repository is **not** attempting to:

- Give medical advice
- Provide regulatory or safety analysis
- Make claims about optimal or proprietary designs

Numbers are approximate unless explicitly sourced.
